# Zenbones

Zenbones is a light vim/nvim colorscheme designed to highlight code using
contrasts and font variations. Colors are tasked only for other roles such as
diagnostics, diffs, search matches.

It's made using the handy [lush.nvim](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim).

## Requirements

Primarily built for nvim but it works pretty well with vim. However here are
some requirements to take full advantage of the colorscheme:

- 24-bit RGB colors (nvim or vim compiled with +termguicolors)
- Font with bold and italic
- Terminal or GUI with bold and italic support

## Installation

Example installation using packer:

```lua
-- packer
use "mcchrish/zenbones.nvim"

-- Optionally install lush. Useful if you want to extend the theme
-- e.g. create a statusline plugin theme using zenbones colors
use "rktjmp/lush.nvim"
```

## Usage

Just apply the colorscheme as usual:

```vim
set termguicolors
colorscheme zenbones
```

Alternatively, if you want to make use of the lua version:

```vim
set termguicolors
colorscheme zenbones-lua
```

It works pretty much the same as the first one however you have to also install
lush.

## Inspirations

Zenbones is heavily inspired by
[Verdandi](https://github.com/be5invis/vsc-theme-verdandi) and
[vim-yin-yang](https://github.com/pgdouyon/vim-yin-yang). The name came from a
book called
[Zen Flesh, Zen Bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Flesh,_Zen_Bones).

There are more similar
[colorschemes with few colors from this collection](https://github.com/mcchrish/vim-no-color-collections).
